Installation
============

1. Start by getting a working version of `Python <http://www.python.org/getit/>`_.
    For Windows users this is most easily done by installing
    `Python (x,y) <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_\ . 

#. ScatPy has the following mandatory dependency (it's installed as standard by
    Python(x,y)):

    * `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/.>`_
    * `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/index.html>`_

    Visualizing targets in 3D also requires: 

    * `mayavi <http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/>`_

#. Download ScatPy from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ScatPy>`_

#. Unzip the package and run ``python setup.py install`` from the command line.

#. Start Python and type ``import ScatPy``. If you don't recieve any import
   warnings then you're ready to go.

Getting Started
===============
Once you have ``ScatPy`` installed, start by reading the :doc:`userguide`
